### Hi, I'm Tim 👋

I am a freelance senior front end web developer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I've worked for several agencies and always enjoy getting involved with a new project or client. I love the ever-changing industry I work in and never stop thinking about it even though my wife thinks I'm slightly obsessed.
